{\bf\large Problem 1: Big-O Notation.}\\

\begin{center}
$f(n) = 10^6 *n^2 + 10^8 * n ^{1.5} + n^3 + 10^{10} * n^{2.99} \leq 10^6 *n^3 + 10^8 * n ^3 + n^3 + 10^{10} * n^3 $ for all $n \geq 1$. \\
$ = (10^6 + 10^8  + 1 + 10^{10}) n^3$\\
\end{center}

Thus there exists a $c = (10^6 + 10^8  + 1 + 10^{10}) > 0$ and an $n_0 = 1 > 0$ such that for all $n \geq n_0 = 1$, $f(n) \leq c*n^3$. Thus $f(n)$ is dominated by $n^3$ and thus $f(n) \in O(n^3)$. \\
